Stage
=====
Stage is a simple presentation program for Mac and Linux.

Stage does not intend to be a full powerpoint replacement. It only will support few types of elements and properties. As we only have limited amount of functionality, the functionality should be intuitive and easy to use and learn.

Stage uses Qt6 and Qt Quick Controls. Idea is to use QML almost as much as possible, and to avoid dependencies to any external libs. This helps to keep the app simple.

Status
------
Basic editing functioanlity starts to be there for simple texts, boxes, circles and linking to external images. This is still far from being actually useful for any purpose, and the progress is slow as this is a hobby project.
